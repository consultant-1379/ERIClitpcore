#test_n_test_03_manifest_no_backup_callback_task_fail

#Description:
#Test that when a plan fails due to a callback task failure,
#a copy of all the puppet manifests are not saved to
#/opt/ericsson/nms/litp/etc/puppet/manifests/plugins.failed/*.pp

# Test Setup
runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at
add-extensions plugins/foo_package
add-plugins plugins/foo_package

# 1. Create model items and reference them
litp create -p /software/items/foo -t foo-package -o name=foo
litp create -p /software/items/bar -t foo-package -o name=bar
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/foo -s /software/items/foo
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/bar -s /software/items/bar

# Setup required to check that a failed callback task doesn't overwrite the manifests
add-plugins ../plugins/failed_callback

# 2. Create plan
litp create_plan

disableCallbackMock cb_fail /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1

# 3. Run plan
litp run_plan

# 4. Wait for the plan to fail due to a callback task failure
assertPlanState failed

# 5. Check that a copy of all the puppet manifests were not saved to the backup directory 
assertDirectoryContents manifests/empty /opt/ericsson/nms/litp/etc/puppet/manifests/plugins.failed/
