## test_01_p_remove_source_item_and_descendent_applied
## Description:
## When a source item in state, "Applied"
## is removed, then the item and its descendants
## and all its corresponding inherited progeny
## will move to "ForRemoval" state
## When the descendent of a source item
## in state, "Applied" is removed
## then the item and its descendants
## and all its corresponding inherited progeny
## will move to "ForRemoval" state
