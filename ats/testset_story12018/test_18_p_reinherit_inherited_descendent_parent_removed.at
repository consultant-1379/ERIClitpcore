## test_18_p_reinherit_inherited_descendent_parent_removed
## Description:
## When an inherited item descendent is removed
## after a successful plan execution,
## and an attempt is made to reinherit
## the removed inherited descendent's parent item
## then a ItemExistsError will be raised

# Actions:
