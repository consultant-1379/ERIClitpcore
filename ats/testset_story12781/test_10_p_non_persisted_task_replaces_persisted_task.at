## test_10_p_non_persisted_task_replaces_persisted_task

## Description:
## Test that when a non-persisted task replaces a persisted task,
## the replacement task will appear in the plan

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a persisted "ConfigTask"
#   (i.e. task persist flag is not set)
# 2.Create an item that results in the task being generated
# 3.Execute "create_plan"
# 4.Check that the task appear in the plan
# 5.Execute "run_plan"
# 6.Create/Update an item that generates a non-persisted task,
#   (i.e. task persist flag = False) that
#   uses the same "ResourceType" and "ResourceID" and is for the same node,
#   of the task that it will replace
# 7.Execute "create_plan"
# 8.Check that the non-persisted replacement task appears in the plan
# 9.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
#   previous item
# 10.Execute "create_plan"
# 11.Check that the replacement task will appear in the plan
#    again
