## test_01_p_set_persist_flag

## Description:
## Test if the persist flag is set to False on a Task,
## the non-persisted task will appear in
## subsequent plans
## Test if the persist flag is set to True on a Task,
## the persisted task will not appear in
## subsequent plans
## Test if the persist flag is not set on a Task,
## the persisted task will not appear in
## subsequent plans

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a non-persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = False)
# 2.Create a plug-in that generates a persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = True)
# 3.Create a plug-in that generates a persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. no task persist flag is set)
# 4.Create items that results in tasks being generated
# 5.Execute "create_plan"
# 6.Check that all tasks appear in the plan
# 7.Execute "run_plan"
# 8.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 9.Execute "create_plan"
# 10.Check that the non-persisted task appears in the plan

# Result:
# When the persist flag of a task is set to False,
