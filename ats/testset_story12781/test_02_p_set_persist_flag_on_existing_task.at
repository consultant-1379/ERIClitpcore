## test_02_p_set_persist_flag_on_existing_task

## Description:
## Test if the persist flag is set to False on a Task that is
## currently persisted, the now non-persisted task will appear in
## subsequent plans

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. no task persist flag is set)
# 2.Create items that results in task being generated
# 3.Execute "create_plan"
# 4.Check that the task appears in the plan
# 5.Execute "run_plan"
# 6.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 7.Execute "create_plan"
# 8.Check that the persisted task does not appear in the plan
# 9.Update the item associated with the task, so that the
# persist flag of the task is set to False
# 10.Execute "create_plan"
# 11.Check that the task appears in the plan
# 12.Execute "run_plan"
# 13.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 14.Execute "create_plan"
# 15.Check that the non-persisted task appears in the plan
# 16.Update the item associated with the task, so that the
# persist flag of the task is set to True
# 17.Execute "create_plan"
# 18.Check that the task appears in the plan
# 19.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 20.Execute "create_plan"
# 21.Check that the now persisted task does not appear in the plan
