## test_11_n_non_persisted_task_failure

## Description:
## Test that if a non-persisted task fails,
## and its associated item type has its APD flag
## set to false, when the plan is re-created,
## the non-persisted task appears in the plan

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a non-persisted "ConfigTask"
#   (i.e. task persist flag is set to False)
# 2.Create an item that results in the task being generated
#   and other tasks
# 3.Execute "create_plan"
# 4.Execute "run_plan"
# 5.Fail the non-persisted task
# 6.Check its state and that its APD flag is set to False
# 7.Execute "create_plan"
# 8.Check that the non-persisted task appears in the plan
