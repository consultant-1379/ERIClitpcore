## test_05_p_persisted_task_depends_on_persisted_task_depends_on_non_persisted_task

## Description:
## Test that when a persisted task depends on a persisted task,
## that depends on a non-persisted task,
## all three tasks will appear in subsequent plans

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = True)
# that depends on a persisted task
# (i.e. no task persist flag present)
# that depends on a non-persisted task
# (i.e. task persist flag = False)
# 3.Create items that results in tasks being generated
# 4.Execute "create_plan"
# 5.Check that all tasks appear in the plan
# 6.Execute "run_plan"
# 7.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 8.Execute "create_plan"
# 9.Check that all three tasks appear in the plan

# 1 - 2.

# 7 - 8. Recreate plan (plugin returns exact same tasks)

# 9. All three tasks come back (as the non persisted dependency is not saved, therefore
# when the task comes back from the plugin core doesn't filter it as its different)

# Result:
# When the persist flag of a task is set to False,
