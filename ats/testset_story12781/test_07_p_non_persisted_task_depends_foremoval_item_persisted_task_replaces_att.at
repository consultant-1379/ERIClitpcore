## test_07_p_non_persisted_task_depends_foremoval_item_persisted_task_replaces_att

## Description:
## Test that when a non-persisted task depends on a persisted task that
## is associated with an item in state, "ForRemoval", the non-persisted
## task and a replacement task will appear in the plan

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a non-persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = False)
# that depends on a persisted task
# (i.e. task persist flag is not set)
# 2.Create items that results in tasks being generated
# 3.Execute "create_plan"
# 4.Check that all tasks appear in the plan
# 5.Execute "run_plan"
# 6.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 7.Execute "create_plan"
# 8.Check that the non-persisted tasks appear in the plan
# 9.Remove the item associated with the persisted task
# resulting in the plug-in using the replaces attribute
# with the "ResourceType" and "ResourceID" of the persisted task
# 10.Execute "create_plan"
# 11.Check that the plan contains the non-persisted task
# and a replacement task
