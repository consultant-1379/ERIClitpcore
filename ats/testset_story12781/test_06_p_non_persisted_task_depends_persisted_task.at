## test_06_p_non_persisted_task_depends_persisted_task

## Description:
## Test that when a non-persisted task depends on a persisted task,
## only the non-persisted task will appear in subsequent plans

# Actions:
# 1.Create a plug-in that generates a non-persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = False)
# that depends on a persisted task
# (i.e. task persist flag = True)
# 2.Create a plug-in that generates a non-persisted "ConfigTask"
# (i.e. task persist flag = False)
# that depends on a persisted task
# (i.e. task persist flag is not set)
# 3.Create items that results in tasks being generated
# 4.Execute "create_plan"
# 5.Check that all tasks appear in the plan
# 6.Execute "run_plan"
# 7.Create items that generate tasks unrelated to
# previous item
# 8.Execute "create_plan"
# 9.Check that the non-persisted tasks appear in the plan
