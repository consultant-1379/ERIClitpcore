## test_01_p_replace_task
## Description:
## Test that an existing persisted tasks can be replaced on the same node

## Prerequisite:
## Create a plug-in that generates persisted tasks

## Actions:
## 1. Create a model item that generates persisted ConfigTasks
## 2. Create Plan
## 3. Run plan
## 4. Update model items so plug-in will generate replacement tasks
##    plug-in original persisted: (foo1, bar1)
##    plug-in original persisted: (foo2, bar2)
##    plug-in original persisted: (foo3, bar3)
##    plug-in replacement task1: (fooX, barX), replaces: (foo1, bar1)
##    plug-in replacement task2: (fooY, barY), replaces: (foo2, bar2), (foo3, bar3)
## 5. Create plan
## 6. Run plan
## 7. Check replacement tasks exist in manifest and the replaced
##    tasks have been removed from the manifest

## Results:
## A plug-in that generates a replacement Config Task at create_plan
## results in core removing the Config Task(s) specified by "replaces"
## during run_plan and adding the replacement Config Task to the manifest
