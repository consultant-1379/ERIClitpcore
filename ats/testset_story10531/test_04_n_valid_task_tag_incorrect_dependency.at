# Test Case 04.

# Description:
# Test that on creating a plan with the deployment ruleset defined with tasks
# tag set and valid but with an invalid dependency on another task (e.g.
# tasks are in different groups), the task validation will raise an error
# Test that a task validation error is raised for invalid dependency for
#    - direct 'task-to-task' dependency within the same plugin
#    - ConfigTask dependency using call type/id between two different plugins.
#    - 'queryItem' dependency between two different plugins.
#
# Actions:
#  1. Create a model item that is the target of a task associated with a valid
#     task's tag with an invalid direct 'task-to-task' dependency
#  2. Execute "create_plan" command
#  3. Check that an internal server error is raised and that error message is
#     logged
#  4. Remove the model item that is the target of the task with the invalid
#     direct 'task-to-task' dependency
#  5. Create a model item that is the target of a task associated with a valid
#     task's tag with an invalid ConfigTask dependency using call type/id
#  6. Execute "create_plan" command
#  7. Check that an internal server error is raised and that eror message is
#     logged
#  8. Remove the model item that is the target of the task with the invalid
#     ConfigTask dependency using call type/id
#  9. Create a model item that is the target of a task associated with a valid
#     task's tag with an invalid 'queryItem' dependency for tasks on different
#     nodes, same group
# 10. Execute "create_plan" command
# 11. Check that an internal server error is raised and that error message is
#     logged
# 12. Remove the model item that is the target of the task with the invalid
#     'queryItem' dependency for tasks on different nodes, same group
# 13. Create a model item that is the target of a task associated with a valid task's
#     tag with an invalid 'queryItem' dependency for tasks on same node,
#     different groups and invalid group order dependency
# 14. Execute "create_plan" command
# 15. Check that an internal server error is raised and that error message is
#     logged
# 16. Remove the model item that is the target of the task with the invalid
#     'queryItem' dependency for tasks on same node, different group
# 17. Create a model item that is the target of a task associated with a valid task's
#     tag with an invalid 'queryItem' dependency for same group with a task
#     associated with a node and the other with ms
# 18. Execute "create_plan" command
# 19. Check that an internal server error is raised and that error message is
#     logged
#
# Result:
#   An internal server error is raised and an error message is logged during
#   execution of 'create_plan' command when an invalid task dependency is set
#   for either direct 'task-to-task' dependency, ConfigTask dependency using
#   call type/id or 'queryItem' dependency for tasks with valid tags.
