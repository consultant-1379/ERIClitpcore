# Test Case 03.

# Description:
# Test that on creating a plan with deployment ruleset defined and an invalid
# task's tag is set and not matching any ruleset criteria, the task will be
# assigned to the MS_GROUP and will get ordered in the correct phase.
# A warning message is also raised for the invalid tag's task.
#
# Actions:
# 1. Create model item that generates a task associated with a tag not defined
#    in the ruleset, with no dependency between tasks
# 2. Execute "create_plan" command
# 3. Check plan
# 3.1 Check that the plan was created
# 3.2 Check that the task with the invalid tag's name is in the MS phase
# 3.3 Check that a warning message for "Invalid task tag name" is raised and
#     specifies the unmatched task's tag
#
# Result:
# On plan creation with a task with an invalid tag, the plan is created, the
# task with the invalid tag is in the MS phase and a warning message specifying
# the invalid tag name is raised.
