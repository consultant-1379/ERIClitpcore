# Test Case 07.

# Description:
# Test that on creating a plan with default deployment ruleset defined and a
# valid ordered task list is set with tagged tasks, the tasks will be in the
# correct order and phase.
#
# Actions:
# 1. Create a model item that generates tasks associated with all valid task's
#    tags in an ordered task list
# 2. Execute "create_plan" command
# 3. Check that tagged tasks are in the correct phase of the plan
# 4. Check that tasks from Ordered tasks list are in correct order in plan
# 5. Execute "run_plan" command
# 6. Check manifest file for ordered tasks dependencies 
#
# Result:
# On plan creation, ordered tasks with tags from same group are in
# the correct phase and sequenced in the correct order as per the deployment ruleset
