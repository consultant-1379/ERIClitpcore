# Test Case 01.
## Description:
## Test that on plan creation, the plan does not have phases containing both
## config and callback tasks.
## Rather than being in a mixed phase, config tasks and callback tasks phase are
## in different phases and callback tasks will be scheduled first when there are
## no dependencies.

# Prerequisites
add-plugins plugins/story11955_plugin
add-extensions extensions/story11955_extension

runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at

# Actions
# 1. Create the model items
# 1a.Create a model item 1a
# 1b.Create a model item 1b that inherits model item 1a and generates
#    a Config task and a Callback task with no dependencies
litp create -p /software/items/item1a -t story11955 -o name='item1a' testcase='tc1'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item1a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b

# 1c.Create a model item 2a
# 1d.Create a model item 2b that inherits model item 2a and generates
#    two Config Tasks and two Callback Tasks with no dependencies
litp create -p /software/items/item2a -t story11955 -o name='item2a' testcase='tc1'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item2a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b

# 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
# 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
litp create_plan

# 4. Check that config task and callback task are in different phases
# 4.1 Check that first phase contains only callback tasks for items 1b and 2b
assertTask 0 _cb node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial
assertTask 0 _cb node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 4.2 Check that second phase contains only config tasks for items 1b and 2b
assertTask 1 tc1_res_1b node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial
assertTask 1 tc1_res_2b node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 5. Execute the 'run_plan' command
litp run_plan

# 6. Check that plan is successful
assertPlanState successful

# Result:
# On Plan creation, config and callback tasks are in different phases.
# Callback tasks phase (phase 1) is scheduled before the config tasks phase
# (phase 2) when there are no dependencies.
# Plan can be run successfully
