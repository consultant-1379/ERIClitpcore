# Test Case 04.
## Description:
## Test that on plan creation, the phases resulting from config and callback
## tasks segregation can be merged with other phases while still keeping config
## and callback tasks in different phases.


# Prerequisites
add-plugins plugins/story11955_plugin
add-extensions extensions/story11955_extension

runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at

# Actions:
# 1. Create the model items
# 1a.Create a model item 1a
# 1b.Create a model item 1b that inherits model item 1a and generates one Config
#    task (Cf-1A) and 1 ordered tasks list with one callback task and one config task
#    [CB-1B, Cf-1C]
litp create -p /software/items/item1a -t story11955 -o name='item1a' testcase='tc4'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item1a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b

# 1c.Create a model item 2a
# 1d.Create a model item 2b that inherits model item 2a and generates one Config
#    task (Cf-2A) and 1 ordered tasks list with one callback task and one config task
#    [CB-2B, Cf-2C]
litp create -p /software/items/item2a -t story11955 -o name='item2a' testcase='tc4'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item2a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b

# 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
# 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
litp create_plan

# 4. Check that config tasks and callback tasks are in different phases
# 4.1 Check that first phase contains only callback tasks for items 1b and 2b
assertTask 0 _cb node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial
assertTask 0 _cb node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 4.2 Check that the second phase has consolidated all the config tasks in the same phase
assertTask 1 tc4_res_1b node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial
assertTask 1 tc4_res_1b_ordered node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial
assertTask 1 tc4_res_2b node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial
assertTask 1 tc4_res_2b_ordered node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 5. Execute the 'run_plan' command
litp run_plan

# 6. Check that plan is successful
assertPlanState successful

# Result:
# On Plan creation, config and callback tasks are split in different phases and
# the seperated config tasks are consolidated with subsequent phase
