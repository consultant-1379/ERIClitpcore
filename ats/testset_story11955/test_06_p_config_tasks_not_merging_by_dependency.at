## Test Case 06.
## Description:
## Test that on plan creation, the phases resulting from config and callback
## tasks segregation does not allow merging of config tasks with other phases due to dependency


# Prerequisites
add-plugins plugins/story11955_plugin
add-extensions extensions/story11955_extension

runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at

# Actions:
# 1. Create the model items
# 1a.Create a model item 1a
# 1b.Create a model item 1b that inherits model item 1a and generates two Callback
#   tasks (CB1 and CB2)
litp create -p /software/items/item1a -t story11955 -o name='item1a' testcase='tc6'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item1a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b

# 1c.Create a model item 2a
# 1d.Create a model item 2b that inherits model item 2a and generates two Config
#    tasks (Cf2 and Cf1)
# 1e Add plugin dependencies
#    dependency where Config task Cf1 requires Callback task CB1
#    dependency where Config task Cf2 requires Config task Cf2
#    dependency where Callback task CB2 requires Config task Cf1
litp create -p /software/items/item2a -t story11955 -o name='item2a' testcase='tc6'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item2a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b

# 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
# 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
litp create_plan

# 4. Check that config tasks and callback tasks are in different phases
# 4.1 Check that first phase contain only callback tasks CB1
assertTask 0 _cb1 node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial

# 4.2 Check that the second phase contains only config task Cf1
assertTask 1 tc6_res_2b_first node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 4.3 Check that third phase contains only callback tasks CB2
assertTask 2 _cb2 node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b Initial

# 4.4 Check that the last phase contains the config task Cf2
assertTask 3 tc6_res_2b_second node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 5. Execute the 'run_plan' command
litp run_plan

# 6. Check that plan is successful
assertPlanState successful

# Result:
# On Plan creation, config and callback tasks are split in different phases and
# the config tasks did not merge into the same phase due to dependency
