## Test Case 07.
##Description:
## Test that on plan creation, the phases resulting from config and remote execution
## tasks segregation does not allow merging of remote execution tasks with other phases due to dependency
##
## 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
## 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
## 4. Check that config tasks and callback tasks are in different phases

# Prerequisites
add-plugins plugins/story11955_plugin
add-extensions extensions/story11955_extension

runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at

# Actions:
# 1. Create the model items
# 1a.Create a model item 1a
# 1b.Create a model item 1b that inherits model item 1a and generates two remote execution
#   tasks with direct dependency  (RET1 requires RET2)
litp create -p /software/items/item1a -t story11955 -o name='item1a' testcase='tc7'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item1a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b

# 1c.Create a model item 2a
# 1d.Create a model item 2b that inherits model item 2a and generates two Config
#    tasks with no dependency  (Cf1 and Cf2)
litp create -p /software/items/item2a -t story11955 -o name='item2a' testcase='tc7'
litp inherit -s /software/items/item2a -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b

# 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
# 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
litp create_plan

# 4.1 Check that first phase contain only remote execution task RET1
assertRemoteExecutionTask 0 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b node1 lock_unlock_a lock_a

# 4.2 Check that the second phase contains all the config tasks
assertTask 1 tc7_res_2b_first node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial
assertTask 1 tc7_res_2b_second node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item2b Initial

# 4.3 Check that the last phase contains the remote execution task RET2
assertRemoteExecutionTask 2 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item1b node1 lock_unlock_b lock_b

# 5. Execute the 'run_plan' command
litp run_plan

# 6. Check that plan is successful
assertPlanState successful

# Result:
# On Plan creation, config and callback tasks are split in different phases and
# the remote execution tasks did not merge into the same phase due to dependency
