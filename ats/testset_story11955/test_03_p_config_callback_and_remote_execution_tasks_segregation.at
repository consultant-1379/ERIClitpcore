# Test Case 03.
## Description:
## Test that on plan creation, the plan allows phases containing both
## callback and remote execution tasks. The plan does not contain phases where
## config and call back tasks are mixed nor phases where config and remote
## execution tasks are mixed.
## Config tasks phase is scheduled after the phases containing callback and/or
## remote execution tasks

# Actions:
# 1. Create the model items
# 1a.Create a model item 1a
# 1b.Create a model item 1b that inherits model item 1a and generates a Config
#    task, a Callback task and a remote execution task with no dependency

# 1e.Create a model item 3a

# 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
# 3. Execute the 'show_plan' command
litp create_plan

# 4. Check that config tasks are in different phases from callback tasks and remote execution tasks
# 4.1 Check that first phase contain mixed callback and remote execution tasks
#     but no config tasks
## LITPCDS-13364 validate remote execution task description displayed in plan

# 5. Execute the 'run_plan' command
litp run_plan

# 6. Check that plan is successful
assertPlanState successful
# Result:
# On Plan creation, the plan allows mixed callback and remote execution tasks
# in the same phase. Callback and remote execution tasks can also be separated
# through dependencies.
# Config tasks phase is scheduled after the callback and/or remote execution
# tasks phases
# Plan can be run successfully
