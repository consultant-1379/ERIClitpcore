## Description:
## When a source item or a source descendent of a doubly inherited item with a state
## "Applied" is removed, the item and its descendants
## (which encompasses inherited progeny and double inherited progeny)
## will move to "ForRemoval" state
## Inherited Items in state initial are be directly removed
## when their progeny and inherited progeny are in state initial
##
## Preconditions: (Indirect Double inheritance)
## Source item itemA: /software/items/itemA
## Source item itemB: /software/services/itemB
## Inherited item item1 (source is itemA): /software/services/itemB/packages/item1
## Inherited item item3 (source is itemA): /software/services/itemB/packages/item3
## Inherited item item4 (source is itemA): /software/services/itemB/packages/item4
## Inherited item item2 (source is itemB) : /deployments/d1/clusters/c1/nodes/n1/services/item2
## The doubly indirectly inherited item1X is implicitly inherited from /software/services/itemB/packages/Item1
## The doubly indirectly inherited item3X is implicitly inherited from /software/services/itemB/packages/Item3
## The doubly indirectly inherited item4X is implicitly inherited from /software/services/itemB/packages/Item4

# removed by executing a plan
# Inherited Items in state initial are directly removed
