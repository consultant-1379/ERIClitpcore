#   Purpose:
#       This AT was created to replace Story46,
#       test_10_p_create_plan_after_plan_stop_remaining_tasks
#       and complement Story2240,
#       test_03_n_no_remove_create_run_stop_plan_state_stopping
#       Story46 and Story2240 tests can be found as follows:
#       ERIClitpcore-testware/python-testcases/src/main/resources/core/testset_story46.py
#       ERIClitpcore-testware/python-testcases/src/main/resources/core/testset_story2240.py
#
#   Description:
#       This checks that when a plan is run and stopped before all of its
#       tasks are completed, that a subsequently created plan includes
#       the remaining tasks from the previous plan.
#   Actions:
#       1. Create test package for node and management server
#       2. Create and run plan.
#       3. Stop plan after first phase.
#       4. Verify that task from first phase was applied successfully.
#        and that tasks belonging to second phase are still at Initial
#       5. Issue the create plan command.
#       6. Verify that new plan contains the remaining tasks to be executed
#   Results:
#       A plan is created containing the tasks remaining to be executed
#       from the previous plan.
