#test_08_n_view_gives_malformed_value
#=========================================
#Description:
#Test that on a cluster whose item type provides a node_upgrade_ordering view, when that view yields a malformed value, plan creation will fail.

#Actions:
#1. Follow install instructions
#2. Create a deployment model that includes a cluster of a type that implements a {{node_upgrade_ordering}} view
#3. Change the behaviour of the view so that it returns a malformed value (eg. a dictionary or a list of integers)
#4. Execute "create_plan" command
#5. Check that a ViewError is raised and the command fails
#
#Result:
#Plan creation fails.
