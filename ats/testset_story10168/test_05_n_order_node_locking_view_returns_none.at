#test_05_n_order_node_locking_view_returns_none
#==============================================
#Description:
#Test that on the VCS cluster, the node upgrade ordering will continue
#with existing behaviour if the view returns None

#Actions:
#Presequite:
#LITP installed and deployed with VCS cluster
#1. Create a new deployment
#2. Ensure that the view "node_upgrade_ordering" returns, "None"
#3. Follow upgrade steps
#4. Execute "create_plan" command
#5. Check that the plan uses the existing behaviour to order the nodes
#6. Execute "run_plan" command

#Result:
#The node upgrade ordering will continue
#with existing behaviour if the view returns, "None" and the upgrade is successful

#1. Create a new deployment
#2. Ensure the node ordering is not provided by the view "node_upgrade_ordering"
#3. Follow upgrade steps
