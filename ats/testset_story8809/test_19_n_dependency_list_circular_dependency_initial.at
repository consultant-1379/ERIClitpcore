# test_19_n_dependency_list_circular_dependency
# =============================================

# Actions:
# 1. Create a deploymemt with multiple clusters
# 2. Add clusters to the "dependency_list" property
# to create a circular dependency as follows:
# CX is dependent on CY
# CY is dependent on CZ
# CZ is dependent on CX
# 3. Follow upgrade steps
# 4. After upgrade plan is created, check that
# a ValidationError is returned indicating that
# a circular dependency exists
# 5. Remove the offending cluster from the list
# 6. Recreate the plan
# 7. After upgrade plan is created, check that the
# tasks are ordered as per the order
# in the "dependency_list" property
# 8. Run plan

# Result:
# Correct validation Errors are returned

# 1. Create multi cluster deployment
add-extensions ../plugins/dummy_8809

# 2. Update the "dependency_list" property to create a circular dependency
# cluster_1 -> cluster_2 -> cluster_3 -> cluster_1
litp update -p /deployments/litpcds_8809/clusters/cluster_3 -o dependency_list='cluster_1'

# 3. Create configurations for clusters
# See step 1
# 4. Create plan and check for error

# 5. Remove offending cluster

# 6. Recreate the plan, no errors

# 8. Run plan, no errors
