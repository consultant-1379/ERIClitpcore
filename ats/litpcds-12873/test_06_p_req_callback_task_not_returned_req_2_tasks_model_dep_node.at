## test_06_p_req_callback_task_not_returned_req_2_tasks_model_dep_node
## Description:
## Ensure that when a required Callback task is not returned by the plugin,
## which in turns requires 2 tasks (one returned and one not returned),
## the model defined dependencies which are defined on the 'node' item types
## are taken into account in the plan (config and callback tasks) and the manifest
## (Config tasks only).

## Prerequisiste
## Plugin generates a required Callback task (t2) which is not returned which in turns
## requires 2 tasks (t4 returned) and (t5 not returned)
## t1 - Config task associated with 'software-item' item type
## t1 requires t2
## t2 - Callback task associated with 'node-config' item type (not returned by plugin)
## t3 - Config task associated with 'file_system' item type
## t3 requires t4 and t5
## t4 - Config task associated with 'routes' item type (route-a)
## t5 - Config task associated with 'routes' item type (route-b) (not returned by plugin)

# Define 2 nodes deployment
runLitpScript ../include/two_nodes.at

## Actions:

## 1. Create Model items on node
## "software-item" item type
litp create -p /software/items/item -t software-item
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item_tc6 -s /software/items/item

## "node-config" item type
litp create -p /ms/configs/config_tc6 -t node-config
litp create -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/configs/config_tc6 -t node-config

## "file-system" item type
litp create -p /infrastructure/storage/nfs_mounts/file_system -t file-system-base
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/file_systems/file_system_tc6 -s /infrastructure/storage/nfs_mounts/file_system

## "route" item type
litp create -p /infrastructure/networking/routes/route -t route-base
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/routes/route_a_tc6 -s /infrastructure/networking/routes/route
litp inherit -p /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/routes/route_b_tc6 -s /infrastructure/networking/routes/route

## 2. Execute the 'create_plan' command
litp create_plan

## 3.1 Check that the tasks associated with software-item, node-config, routes
## and filesystem are all in the plan, even though the tasks associated with
## 'node-config' and 'route' model items were not returned by the plugin.
assertTask 0 node::file_systems node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/file_systems/file_system_tc6
assertTask 0 node::routes_a node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/routes/route_a_tc6

assertCallbackTask _cb /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/configs/config_tc6
assertTask 2 node::items node1 /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item_tc6

##3.2 Check tasks dependencies (t1 requires t2)
let __task1_node1 ConfigTask node1 node::items id_node_item /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/items/item_tc6
let __task2_node1 CallbackTask _cb /deployments/local/clusters/cluster1/nodes/node1/configs/config_tc6
assertTaskBeforeTask __task2_node1 __task1_node1

## 4. Execute the 'run__plan' command
litp run_plan

## 5. Assert puppet manifest
## Model defined dependency for the required tasks that were not returned by
## the plugin are present in the manifest:
## Task (t1) associated with 'software-item' item type requires tasks (t3)
## associated with 'file_system' item type (model defined dependency) and also
## requires tasks (t4, t5) associated with 'routes' item type ('route_a and route_b')
